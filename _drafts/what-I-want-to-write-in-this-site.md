What I want to write in this site also means what you are gonna read here. I used to write my moods or emotions in blogs. Then my friends may read it and kindly comment to me. But finally that kind of blogs always have a short life and no one gives a shit after two weeks. That is not what I want to do in this site.

Of course, we all have mood. we see, we listen, we feel this world and each other. It's so normal and sometimes makes the world so diverse and colorful. I have no complaint on it at all. The only fact I realised is that I want to do something matters, something helpful for others.

It should not be self-centered expressions or even catharsis. If I am a artist or a singer, things may change because their emotions can level-up their arts or performance. Unfortunately, I am so bad at that.

So, what kind of things should matter? I have no answer. But I think it depends on audience. 

> What kind of people are you?

No matter what is the answer of the questions above, I've made a list of things I am goona writing:

The First one comes up to me is Salesforce, on which I've worked for nearly 7 years. The experience may help. Besides, I'm on the middle of the journey to Salesforce certificated Technical Artitect. Sharing to the community should also help me in the other way, I think.

The second one is some thoughts about specific topics which i think are interesting or meaningful to think deeper.

Life is continuous learing and there are always more surprises waiting for you. The answer for the title of this article should be: you will know when you read.
