* Studying on a trailmix named Sharing and Visibility Architect Journey.
* Preparing the exam of IT Passport.
* Using the code which I used for the first personal website to rebuild this static blog with Github page. Trying to make it cooler and bigger.
* Want to figure out what is the best way to communicate with my parents and friends after an almost half a year disconnection.
* Learning to use Revealjs to create PPTs.
* Watching _It's OK to not be OK_.
