A Salesforce consultant and developer since 2013, a blogger since recently, alive since 1991.

I closed comment function and determined not to put a RSS button in the navigation menu for some UI considering. If you want to get in touch with me, you can send to my personal email [choose0or7@gmail.com](mailto:choose0or7@gmail.com).

Last but not the least, in this part I would like to recommend a blog written by a freelance web developer named Manu. [His blog](https://manuelmoreale.com/) inspired me so much. It's very minimalism stylished, with very high quality in both content and visual design.
