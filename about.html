    <p>Last but not the least, in this part I would like to recommend a blog written by a freelance web developer named Manu. <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/">His blog</a> inspired me so much. It's very minimalism stylished, but in the other hand, with very high quality in both content and visual design. The blog looks so simple that seems like no one would find or really read into. However, the fact is that it has millions of visitors since 2017. That blew my mind.</p>
    <p>Check it! If you read to here but are still hesitating. I'm sure your will have a fun reading.</p>
